# Bat_Attack_Genetic_Algorithm


This program is a Genetic Algorithm where the bats try to find their way to the cube on the top of the screen. It utilizes the processing enviroment for graphics. The DNA object is an array of delta directions that the bats use to change directions and the fitness function is based on the absolute distence between the bats and the cube.
